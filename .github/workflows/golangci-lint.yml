          # Note: we can set `--issues-exit-code=0` if we want a successcode always,
          #  indicating that the linter ran successfully (weather or not linter errors
          #  exist or not doesn't matter). But the good think is that the annotations
          #  will still show up. I think this can be useful if we don't want the pipeline
          #  to stop just because we had some linter errors.

          # Optional: we can set the below to `true` if we only want to see newly introduced
          #  linter errors, however I found that in practive that option is a bit gimmicky,
          #  as it passes the linter check despite having new linter errors in some cases.
          #  So we opt in for all annotations of linter errors to show up, this is actually
          #  nicer because we suppress our linter errors manually anyways so there shouldn't
          #  be any linter errors anyways. The enforces us to always have a clean lint state.
