DefraDB is a database advancing data ownership, personal privacy, and information security, with the user as its center. Its data model, powered by the convergence of [MerkleCRDTs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00107.pdf), and content-addressability of [IPLD](https://docs.ipld.io/), makes possible a multi-write-master architecture. It features [DQL](https://docs.source.network/query-specification/query-language-overview), a query language compatible with GraphQL but providing extra convenience. By leveraging peer-to-peer networking and [WebAssembly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly), it can be deployed nimbly in novel topologies. Access control is determined by a relationship-based DSL, supporting document or field-level policies, secured by the  SourceHub network. It is a core part of the [Source technologies](https://source.network/) which enable new paradigms of decentralized data and access-control management, user-centric apps, data trustworthiness, and much more.

## Early Access

DefraDB is currently in a *Early Access Alpha* program, and is not yet ready for production deployments. Please email the [Source](https://source.network/) team at [hello@source.network](mailto:hello@source.network) for support with your use-case and deployment.

DISCLAIMER: In this current *Alpha* stage, DefraDB doesn't offer access control or encryption of data and the default configuration expose the database to the network.


## Install

Install `defradb` by [downloading an executable binary](https://github.com/sourcenetwork/defradb/releases), or building it locally using the [Go toolchain](https://golang.org/):
```sh
git clone git@github.com:sourcenetwork/defradb.git
cd defradb
make install
```

In what follows, we assume that `defradb` is included in your `PATH`. If you installed it with the Go toolchain, it would be:

```sh
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin`
```

We recommend to play around with queries using a native GraphQL client. GraphiQL is a popular option - [download and install it](https://www.electronjs.org/apps/graphiql).


## Start

Start a node by executing `defradb start`. Keep the node running going through the following examples.

Verify local connection to the node works, by executing `defradb client ping` in another terminal.


## Configuration

In this document, we use the default configuration, which has the following behavior:

- `~/.defradb/` is DefraDB's configuration and data directory
- `client` command interacts with the locally running node
- the GraphQL endpoint is provided at http://localhost:9181/api/v0/graphql

The GraphQL endpoint can be used with a GraphQL client (e.g. GraphiQL) to conveniently perform requests (`query`, `mutation`) and obtain schema introspection.


## Add a schema type

Schemas are used to structure documents using a type system.

In the following examples, we'll be using a simple `User` schema type.

Add it to the database with the following. By doing so, DefraDB generates the typed GraphQL endpoints for querying, mutation, introspection.
```shell
defradb client schema add '
  type User {
    name: String 
    age: Int 
    verified: Boolean 
    points: Float
  }
'
```

Find more examples of schema type definitions in the [examples/schema/](examples/schema/) folder.


## Create a document instance

Submit a `mutation` request to create an instance of the `User` type:
```shell
defradb client query '
  mutation {
      create_User(data: "{\"age\": 31, \"verified\": true, \"points\": 90, \"name\": \"Bob\"}") {
          _key
      }
  }
'
```

Expected response:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "_key": "bae-91171025-ed21-50e3-b0dc-e31bccdfa1ab",
    }
  ]
}
```

The document's `_key` is a unique identifier added to each document in a DefraDB node, determined by its schema and initial data.


## Query documents

Once we have populated our local node with data, we can query it:
```shell
defradb client query '
  query {
    User {
      _key
      age
      name
      points
    }
  }
'
```

This query obtains *all* users and returns their fields `_key, age, name, points`. GraphQL queries only returns the exact fields requested.

We can further filter results with the `filter` argument.
```shell
defradb client query '
  query {
    User(filter: {points: {_ge: 50}}) {
      _key
      age
      name
      points
    }
  }
'
```

This returns only user documents which have a value for the `points` field *Greater Than or Equal to* (`_ge`) 50.


## Obtain document commits

DefraDB's data model is based on [MerkleCRDTs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.00107.pdf). Each document has a graph of all of its updates, similar to Git. The updates are called `commit`s, and are identified by `cid`, a content identifier. Each references its parents by their `cid`s.

To get the most recent commit in the MerkleDAG for the document identified as `bae-91171025-ed21-50e3-b0dc-e31bccdfa1ab`:
```shell
defradb client query '
  query {
    latestCommits(dockey: "bae-91171025-ed21-50e3-b0dc-e31bccdfa1ab") {
      cid
      delta
      height
      links {
        cid
        name
      }
    }
  }
'
```

It returns a structure similar to the following, which contains the update payload that caused this new commit (`delta`), and any subgraph commits it references.
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "cid": "bafybeidembipteezluioakc2zyke4h5fnj4rr3uaougfyxd35u3qzefzhm",
      "delta": "pGNhZ2UYH2RuYW1lY0JvYmZwb2ludHMYWmh2ZXJpZmllZPU=",
      "height": 1,
      "links": [
        {
          "cid": "bafybeieelb43ol5e5jiick2p7k4p577ph72ecwcuowlhbops4hpz24zhz4",
          "name": "age"
        },
        {
          "cid": "bafybeigwjkwz7eobh6pqjal4yfpsahnv74cxedxqnmhnmp3iojoc4xs25i",
          "name": "name"
        },
        {
          "cid": "bafybeigr72knx43euvxz34sqipjrfpcgibr7uuihko4aqxqutkkmzhqm24",
          "name": "points"
        },
        {
          "cid": "bafybeig653zyvev625vkn5kveuhyzqnychvoqhyx52pznbre227olkzkpi",
          "name": "verified"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Obtain a specific commit by its content identifier (`cid`):
```gql
defradb client query '
  query {
    commits(cid: "bafybeidembipteezluioakc2zyke4h5fnj4rr3uaougfyxd35u3qzefzhm") {
      cid
      delta
      height
      links {
        cid
        name
      }
    }
  }
'
```


## DefraDB Query Language (DQL)

DQL is compatible with GraphQL, but features various extensions.

Read its documentation at [docs.source.network](https://docs.source.network/query-specification/query-language-overview) to discover its filtering, ordering, limiting, relationships, variables, aggregate functions, and further useful features.


## Securing the HTTP API with TLS

By default, DefraDB will expose the HTTP API at `http://localhost:9181/api/v0`. It's also possible to configure the API to use TLS with self signed certificates or Let's Encrypt.

To start defradb with self signed certificates placed under `~/.defradb/certs/` with `server.key`
being the public key and `server.crt` being the private key, just do:
```shell
defradb start --tls
```

The keys can be generated with your generator of choice or with `make tls-certs`.

Since the keys should be stored within the DefraDB data and configuration directory, the recommended key generation command is `make tls-certs path="~/.defradb/certs"`.

If not saved under `~/.defradb/certs` then the public (`pubkeypath`) and private (`privkeypaths`) key paths need to be
explicitly defined inaddition to the `--tls` flag or `tls` set to `true` in the config.

Then to start the server with TLS, using your generated keys in custom path:
```shell
defradb start --tls --pubkeypath ~/path-to-pubkey.key --privkeypath ~/path-to-privkey.crt

```

Note the following example can sometimes not properly expand `~` and can cause problems:
```shell
defradb start --tls --pubkeypath="~/path-to-pubkey.key" --privkeypath="~/path-to-privkey.crt"
```

DefraDB also comes with automatic HTTPS for deployments on the public web. To enable HTTPS,
 deploy DefraDB to a server with both port 80 and port 443 open. With your domain's DNS A record
 pointed to the IP of your server, you can run the database using the following command:
```shell
sudo defradb start --tls --url=your-domain.net --email=email@example.com
```
Note: `sudo` is needed above for the redirection server (to bind port 80).

A valid email address is necessary for the creation of the certificate, and is important to
 get notifications from the Certificate Authority - in case the certificate is about to expire, etc.


## Peer-to-peer data synchronization
DefraDB leverages peer-to-peer networking for data exchange, synchronization, and the replication of documents and commits.

When starting a node for the first time, a key pair is generated and stored in its "root directory" (commonly `~/.defradb/`).

Each node has a unique `Peer ID` generated from its public key. This ID allows other nodes to connect to it.

There are two types of peer-to-be relationships nodes support: **pubsub** peering and **replicator** peering.

Pubsub peering *passively* synchronizes data between nodes by broadcasting Document Commit updates with the document key (`DocKey`) as the topic. Nodes need to already be listening on the pubsub channel to receive updates. This is for when two nodes *already* have a shared document and want to keep both their changes in sync with one another.

Replicator peering *actively* pushes changes from a specific collection *to* a target peer.


### Pubsub example

Pubsub peers can be specified on the command line using the `--peers` flag which accepts a comma-separated list of peer [multiaddress](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/addressing/). For example, a node at `192.168.1.12` listening on 9000 with Peer ID `12D3KooWNXm3dmrwCYSxGoRUyZstaKYiHPdt8uZH5vgVaEJyzU8B` would be referred to using the multiaddress  `/ip4/192.168.1.12/tcp/9000/p2p/12D3KooWNXm3dmrwCYSxGoRUyZstaKYiHPdt8uZH5vgVaEJyzU8B`.

Let's go through an example of two nodes (*nodeA* and *nodeB*) connecting with each other over pubsub, on the same machine.

Start *nodeA* with a default configuration:
```
defradb start
```

Obtain the Peer ID from its console output. In this example, we assume `12D3KooWNXm3dmrwCYSxGoRUyZstaKYiHPdt8uZH5vgVaEJyzU8B`, but locally it will be different.

For *nodeB*, we provide the following configuration:
```
defradb start --rootdir ~/.defradb-nodeB --url localhost:9182 --p2paddr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9172 --tcpaddr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9162 --peers /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9171/p2p/12D3KooWNXm3dmrwCYSxGoRUyZstaKYiHPdt8uZH5vgVaEJyzU8B
```

About the flags:

- `--rootdir` specifies the root dir (config and data) to use
- `--url` is the address to listen on for the client HTTP and GraphQL API
- `--p2paddr` is the multiaddress for the p2p networking to listen on
- `--tcpaddr` is the multiaddress for the gRPC server to listen on
- `--peers` is a comma-separated list of peer multiaddresses

This starts two nodes and connect them via pubsub networking.


### Collection subscription example

It is possible to subscribe to updates on a given collection by using its ID as the pubsub topic. After setting up 2 nodes as shown in the [Pubsub example](#pubsub-example) section, we can subscribe to collections update on *nodeA* from *nodeB* by using the `rpc p2pcollection` command:
```shell
defradb client rpc p2pcollection add --url localhost:9182 <collectionID>
```
Multiple collection IDs can be added at once.
```shell
defradb client rpc p2pcollection add --url localhost:9182 <collection1ID> <collection2ID> <collection3ID>
```

### Replicator example

Replicator peering is established in one direction. For example, a *nodeA* can be given a *nodeB* to actively send updates to, but *nodeB* won't send updates in return. However, nodes broadcast updates of documents over document-specific pubsub topics, therefore *nodeB* while it won't replicate directly to *nodeA*, it will *passively*.

Let's go through an example of *nodeA* actively replicating to *nodeB*:

Start *nodeA*:
```shell
defradb start
```

In another terminal, add this example schema to it:
```shell
defradb client schema add '
  type Article {
    content: String
    published: Boolean
  }
'
```

Start *nodeB*, that will be receiving updates:
```shell
defradb start --rootdir ~/.defradb-nodeB --url localhost:9182 --p2paddr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9172 --tcpaddr /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9162
```

Notice how we *do not* specify `--peers` as we will manually define a replicator after startup via the `rpc` client command.

In another terminal, add the same schema to *nodeB*:
```shell
defradb client schema add --url localhost:9182 '
  type Article {
    content: String
    published: Boolean
  }
'
```

Set *nodeA* to actively replicate the "Article" collection to *nodeB*:
```shell
defradb client rpc addreplicator "Article" /ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/9172/p2p/<peerID_of_nodeB>
```

As we add or update documents in the "Article" collection on *nodeA*, they will be actively pushed to *nodeB*. Note that changes to *nodeB* will still be passively published back to *nodeA*, via pubsub.
