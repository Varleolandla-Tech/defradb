# Rename _key to _docID

Rename from using older terminology of `_key` to `_docID`, the update is done to all documentation, and throughout the codebase.

- All instances of `(k|K)ey(s|S)` and `(d|D)ockey(s|s)` should have been updated to use the term `(d|D)ocID(s)` instead.

- Usage of id/ids argument has also been updated with docID/docIDs
