package clock

// CRDTs are composed of two structures, the payload and a clock. The
// payload is the actual CRDT data which abides by the merge semantics.
// The clock is a mechanism to provide a casual ordering of events, so
// we can determine which event proceeded eachother and apply the
// various merge strategies.
//
// MerkleCRDTs are similar, they contain a CRDT payload, but instead
// of a logical or vector clock, it uses a MerkleClock.
//
// MerkleClock is a Merkle DAG, which provides casual ordering of nodes
// which link to previous nodes, with content addressable IDs creating a
// fully linked graph of content. The linked graph of nodes creates a
// natural history of events because a parent node contains a CID of a
// child node, which ensures parents occurred AFTER a child.
