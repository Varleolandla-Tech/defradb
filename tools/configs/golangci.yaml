  # can use regexp here: generated.*, regexp is applied on full path;
  # default value is empty list, but default dirs are skipped independently
  # from this option's value (see skip-dirs-use-default).
  # "/" will be replaced by current OS file path separator to properly work
  # on Windows.
  skip-dirs:
    # - net/

  # Enables skipping of directories:
  #   vendor$, third_party$, testdata$, examples$, Godeps$, builtin$
  skip-dirs-use-default: true

  # which files to skip: they will be analyzed, but issues from them
  # won't be reported. Default value is empty list, but there is
  # no need to include all autogenerated files, we confidently recognize
  # autogenerated files. If it's not please let us know.

  # by default isn't set. If set we pass it to "go list -mod={option}". From "go help modules":
  # If invoked with -mod=readonly, the go command is disallowed from the implicit
  # automatic updating of go.mod described above. Instead, it fails when any changes
  # to go.mod are needed. This setting is most useful to check that go.mod does
  # not need updates, such as in a continuous integration and testing system.
  # If invoked with -mod=vendor, the go command assumes that the vendor
  # directory holds the correct copies of dependencies and ignores
  # the dependency descriptions in go.mod.

#===========================================================================[ Linter Specific Severity Configuration ]
severity:
  default-severity: error

  # If set to true severity-rules regular expressions become case sensitive.
  case-sensitive: false

  # Default value is empty list.
  # When a list of severity rules are provided, severity information will be added to lint
